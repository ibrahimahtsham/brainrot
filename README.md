My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world.

No lube, no protection, all night all day from the kitchen floor to the dining table from the bed to church, from the front porch to the balcony, vertically, horizontally, quadratic exponential, logarithmic, while i gasp for air scream the lord's prayer, SEIJI CAN TOP ME until I'm swollen, until I'm crying, until he's out of juice, until I cant walk, until I'm numb, until my throat hurts, until my cheeks are red, until the neighbours know his name, until my insides becomes outsides, until my hole remember the shape, until my jaws fall off, until my leg is useless, until my eyes are rolled back and it stays there, until my body does a backflip, until my whole body shakes, until the skin peels off, until my bones disconnect, until i pass out, until im paralyzed for the rest of my life, until all my eggs are fertilized, until all my holes are filled, until i cant breathe, until it gets longer than before, until he couldn't stand, until i die, until his tentacles dont come anymore, until my mouth cant eat, until i remember the length of it, until the end of time, until he dont have it anymore, until his hole remembers the size and girth, until it reaches my stomach, until hes grunting and growling, until he has to regenerate it, until the whole world hears. I'm gonna get him pregnant ten times over breeding him all day all night no protection just me and him all over the house on the floor on the couch on the bed in the shower on the rooftops even god couldn't pull me out of him.

oh hi mark

Everyone knows Mario is cool as f--k. But who knows what he's thinking? Who knows why he crushes turtles? And why do we think about him as fondly as we think of the mystical (nonexistent?) Dr Pepper? Perchance.
I believe it was Kant who said "Experience without theory is blind, but theory without experience is mere intellectual play." Mario exhibits experience by crushing turts all day, but he exhibits theory by stating "Lets-a go!" Keep it up, baby!
When Mario leaves his place of safety to stomp a turty, he knows that he may Die. And yet, for a man who can purchase lives with money, a life becomes a mere store of value. A tax that can be paid for, much as a rich man feels any law with a fine is a price. We think of Mario as a hero,but he is simply a one percenter of a more privileged variety. The lifekind. Perchance.

Number 15: Burger king foot lettuce. The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get.

Lelouche: Hello?
Suzaku: Hey, what's up?
Lelouche: I need your help, can you come here?
Suzaku: Uh, I can't, I'm buying clothes.
Lelouche: ‚ÄãAlright, well hurry up and come over here.
Suzaku: I can't find them.
Lelouche: What do you mean you can't find them‚Äã?
Suzaku: I can't find them, there's only soup‚Äã.
Lelouche: What do you mean there's only soup?
Suzaku: It means there's only soup!‚Äã
Lelouche: Well then, get out of the soup aisle!
Suzaku: Alright, you don't have to shout at me!
(Footsteps leading into the next aisle)
Suzaku: There's more soup!
Lelouche: What do you mean there's more soup?
Suzaku: There's just more soup!
Lelouche: ‚ÄãGo into the next aisle!
Suzaku: There's still soup!
Lelouche: Where are you right now?
Suzaku: I'm at soup!
Lelouche: What do you mean you're at soup?
Suzaku: I mean I'm at soup!
Lelouche: What store are you in?

Second Xavier: Hello? Hello?
First Xavier: Hello?
Second Xavier: Who's this?
First Xavier: Who's this?
Second Xavier: I'm asking the questions. I called you.
First Xavier: No, I called you. And you sound like the ugliest son of a bitch I ever heard.
Second Xavier: You sound like the physical manifestation of some loser's inner demons.
First Xavier: Well, you sound like some total chode's inability to confront the reality of his past actions.
Second Xavier: If I ever get your stinky mug in my line of sight I swear to Chekov I'll cock your clock off.
First Xavier: Well, I'm going to be the bigger man and hang up first-- Damn it!
(The two walk out of a phone booth, right next to each other)
First Xavier: Listen, we don't cotton to freaks 'round these parts. Scram, weirdo!
Second Xavier: Oh yeah? I don't polycotton to coping tropes, even my own. So why don't you split?
First Xavier: Looks like I already did. You're the sad figment of my twisted psyche's tragic dividend. You're the un-me. I'm the real me. You wanna be me?
Second Xavier: Kiddo, I was the real me when you were still in my short pants.
First Xavier: Hate to break it to you, but I wore them first. Me bequeathed thee the psychopathological hand-you-down.
Second Xavier: So you're the one who stained them!!
First Xavier: Whoever found it, browned it.
Second Xavier: You'd like me to be you, wouldn't me? But it's too late. You snoze, you loze.
First Xavier: You sleeped, you weeped.
Second Xavier: You nap-uh, you get slap-uh.
First Xavier: You slumber, a cucumber.
Second Xavier: You catch up on some zeds, you get out of my heads.
First Xavier: You slumber, ham.. burger I don't want to talk about nothing else.
Second Xavier: Listen, this psyche is not big enough for two metaphysical seekers.
First Xavier: You couldn't seek your way out of a cardboard bag.
Second Xavier: Yeah, I know, cause it would be an egg.
First Xavier: (Thinking) Ooh!!! This guy might be better than me.
Second Xavier: You're right. I am better than me.
First Xavier: Look, buddy, know when you're defeated. Accept your defecation.
Second Xavier: No, thanks. I'm full, cause I eat pussies like you for breakfast.
First Xavier: Look at you, you look so superficial, you probably judge things by their physical appearance.
Second Xavier: Oh yeah? Your mom's so shallow, she probably thinks this quip is about her.
First Xavier: You're about as deep as a bowl of soup, and your tongue is as sharp as a soup spoon.
Second Xavier: Hey, say what you want about me, but lay off the soup.
First Xavier: If you love soup so much, why don't you marry soup?
Second Xavier: 'cause I'm already married. To justice.
First Xavier: Yeah. Only a blind girl would marry you.
Second Xavier: I know everything you're gonna-
First Xavier: say. And I know everything you're gonna-
Second Xavier: don't.
First Xavier: Oh yeah? Well, when God was passing out insight, you thought.. he said that when God was passing out holy prophets, you thought he said "oily faucets", cause your soul has diarrhea of the mouth faucet.
Second Xavier: Are you so dumb you even answer rhetorical questions?
First Xavier: I don't know, do you?
Second Xavier: We can play this game all night.
First Xavier: First of all, it's daytime, and this is no game.
Second Xavier: Checkmate.
First Xavier: Oh! So you admit that you're checking me out and you want to mate.
Second Xavier: Ooh! You got a license to sell hot dogs, chico man?
First Xavier: No. They wouldn't give it to me, because when I was filling out the application, my penis was sticking out.
Second Xavier: Oh, yeah? You only got one penii? Let me see it.
First Xavier: See with your eyes, not with your mouth.
Second Xavier: I'll call your bluff. I'll see your penis with your mouth, and I raise you with my hand.
First Xavier: Ante up.
Second Xavier: Auugh! Damn it!
First Xavier: What's wrong?
Second Xavier: I crapped out, but I'm tough. I can suck it up.
First Xavier: Ok. Count of three, we show what's under the loincloth. Wiener take all.
Both: One, two, three!

You. Me. Gas station. What are we getting for dinner? Sushi of course. Uh oh! There was a roofie in our gas station sushi. We black out and wake up in a sewer surrounded by fish. Horny fish. You know what that means. Fish orgy. The stench draws in a bear. What do we do? We're gonna fight it. Bear fight. Bare handed. Bare, naked? Oh, yes please. We befriend the bear after we beat it in a brawl and ride it into a Chuck E. Cheese. Dance Dance Revolution. Revolution? Overthrow the government? Uh, I think so. Next thing you know, I'm reincarnated as Jesus Christ. Then I turn into a jet, fly into the sun, black out again, wake up, do a bump, white out, which I didn't even know you could do. Then I smoked a joint, greened out. Then I turn into the sun. Uh oh! Looks like the meth is kicking in. aklfhaofhasfahfakh AAAAAAAAA afahfioahflkf AAAAA
